<h1> About Me </h1>

<p style="max-width: 50vw">
I am a graphic designer, maker, and journalist based in Tahlequah, Oklahoma currently employed by the <a href="https://tahlequahdailyptess.com">Tahlequah Daily Press</a> as head of the Composing department, as well as a regional designer serving the CNHI Oklahoma region. My design skills are concentrated in broadsheet layout, magazine layout, web-based UI, and branding.
</p>

<p style="max-width: 50vw">
During my time at the Tahlequah Daily Press I have facilitated the streamlining of our magazine portfolio, design overhauls of products, and the overwhelmingly successful relaunch of Tahlequah Grapevine, a magazine last published in 2011. In addition magazines, I also design broadsheet newspaper pages for daily publication for three papers under tight deadlines.

In addition to my day job, I am in my sixth year of being a freelance digital artist and photographer. This has allowed my to use my broad skillset in 3D modeling, 3D printing, video editing, and graphic design to serve a diverse set of clients on projects ranging from simple websites and 3D printed parts to full scale live video production.
