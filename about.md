<h1> About Me </h1>

<p style="max-width: 50vw; text-indent: 1em;">
I am a graphic designer, maker, and journalist based in Tahlequah, Oklahoma currently employed by the Tahlequah Daily Press as head of the Composing department. My design skills are concentrated in broadsheet & magazine layout, web-based UI, and branding.
</p>

<p style="max-width: 50vw; text-indent: 1em;">
During my time at the Tahlequah Daily Press I have facilitated the streamlining of our magazine portfolio, design overhauls of products, and the overwhelmingly successful relaunch of Tahlequah Grapevine, a magazine last published in 2011. In addition magazines, I also design broadsheet newspaper pages for daily publication under tight deadlines.

<p style="max-width: 50vw; text-indent: 1em;">
In addition to my day job, I am in my sixth year of being a freelance digital artist and photographer. This has allowed my to use my broad skillset in 3D modeling, 3D printing, video editing, and graphic design to serve a diverse set of clients on projects ranging from simple websites to full scale live video production.
